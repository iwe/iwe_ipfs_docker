iWe docker image for Ambitorio's distributed data storage

To build:  
cd docker  
sudo ./build.sh  
(Note: sudo is only needed for the first build as the host system needs to have
 an ipfs user created and $EDS_BASE_PATH needs to be created with the correct
 permissions.)

To start:  
./start.sh

To stop:  
./stop.sh
